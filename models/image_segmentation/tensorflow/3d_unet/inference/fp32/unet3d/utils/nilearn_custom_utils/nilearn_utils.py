def crop_img(img, rtol=1e-8, copy=True, return_slices=False):
    """Crops img as much as possible
    Will crop img, removing as many zero entries as possible
    without touching non-zero entries. Will leave one voxel of
    zero padding around the obtained non-zero area in order to
    avoid sampling issues later on.
    Parameters
    ----------
    img: Niimg-like object
        See http://nilearn.github.io/manipulating_images/input_output.html
        img to be cropped.
    rtol: float
        relative tolerance (with respect to maximal absolute
        value of the image), under which values are considered
        negligeable and thus croppable.
    copy: boolean
        Specifies whether cropped data is copied or not.
    return_slices: boolean
        If True, the slices that define the cropped image will be returned.
    Returns
    -------
    cropped_img: image
        Cropped version of the input image
